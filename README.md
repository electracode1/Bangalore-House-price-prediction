Price-Prediction Model Using ML
In the modern real estate landscape, estimating the accurate market value of residential properties has
become increasingly challenging due to the multitude of influencing factors such as location, square
footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, neighborhood amenities, and proximity to schools and
infrastructure. Traditionally, real estate pricing depended heavily on the intuition and experience of
realtors and appraisers, leading to potential inconsistencies and subjectivity in valuation. With the
emergence of machine learning (ML), a more systematic, data-driven approach to price prediction is now
possible. This technical seminar focuses on the development and implementation of a machine learning-
based model to predict house prices. Using real-world datasets sourced from platforms like Kaggle and
real estate websites, the study explores various stages of model development, including data collection,
preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling), and algorithm
selection. The models used in this work include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests,
chosen for their ability to capture both linear and non-linear relationships between features and target
prices.
The model training process involves splitting data into training and validation sets and evaluating
performance using statistical metrics such as RÂ² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE). These metrics help in assessing the accuracy and robustness of the prediction
models. Once trained, the model can predict property prices for new input data, offering instant and
objective estimates.
practical applications of this technology in real estate portals like
Magicbricks and Zillow, which already utilize similar systems for property valuation. The system can also
benefit banks for loan assessments, government bodies for urban planning, and developers for project
valuation. Future enhancements include integrating deep learning techniques, using satellite and street-
level imagery, incorporating environmental and social data, and building interactive web or mobile
applications
